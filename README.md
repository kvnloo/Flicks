Flicks is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can select from a tab bar for either "Now Playing" or "Top Rated" movies.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] If internet connection is slow or unreliable, the loading state lasts only as long as it takes to get the movie names and descriptions. The movie thumbnails are loaded afterwards, when the user can interact with the application. This prioritizes the movie names and descriptions over the optional movie poster thumbnails.
